MEMO FROM COMMAND TO LT. VADIM<br/>
EYES ONLY<br/>
<br/>
DOOMSDAY PROTOCOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to our good friend in the east, we received last month 70kg of Pu-239.<br/>
They thought us near-sighted: the material given to us was impure, only good for a dirty bomb.<br/>
This is not an obstacle.  The foundry will take a special order, we will have six pure critical masses next week.<br/>
<br/>
Spread the weapons widely: one in each major town, in our safehouses.  Our men must guard this secret closely.<br/>
Let them believe these weapons will strike Moscow to ensure loyalty.  In reality, they are our insurance policy.<br/>
If the revolution is lost, arm the bombs immediately.  The men guarding them will ensure our pyrrhic victory.<br/>
<br/>
This decision is distateful, but we must commit.  This will give us the political power to demand our freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Commander Borscht
